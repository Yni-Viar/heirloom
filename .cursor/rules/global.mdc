# Heirloom apps
- This is two different apps: winfile and progman.
- C++ 20
- Vanilla Win32
- We only support Windows 10 and above. Don't support older systems.
- We only support Unicode. Don't support ANSI. Use WCHAR over TCHAR, LPWSTR over LPTSTR, L"" over TEXT("").
- Do not run the apps. I will run them myself in the debugger for testing.
- Never use the pImpl pattern.

## File Manager (winfile)
- Directory: src/winfile/
- Always run the build with `bash src/build-winfile.sh` after making changes.
- This is the classic Windows File Manager codebase.
- When creating new source files, OMIT the file-level comment header.

## Program Manager (progman)
- Directories: src/progman/, src/libprogman/, src/libprogman_tests
- Always run the build and tests with `bash src/build-progman.sh` after making changes.
- Prefer the C++ Standard Library like std::wstring over old fashioned C like WCHAR* or LPWSTR.
- Use smart pointer classes. Avoid "new".
- Only use old fashioned C conventions when interfacing with Win32 API.
- Never use Hungarian notation.
- Never use C-style casts.
- Member variable names have trailing underscores: fooBar_
- All functions use camelCase: fooBar()
- Use exceptions for error handling. Convert error codes to exceptions ASAP.
- Use wil (Windows Implementation Library) classes for Win32 RAII. Use THROW_IF_FAILED() to handle HRESULTs. Use throwing wrappers.
- Use an immutable style for data classes.
- Add system includes to the project precompiled header: src/progman/pch.h or src/libprogman/pch.h
