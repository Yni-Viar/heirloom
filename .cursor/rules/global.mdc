# Heirloom apps
- C++20
- We only support Windows 10 and above. Don't support older systems.
- We only support Win32 Unicode. Don't support ANSI. Use WCHAR over TCHAR, LPWSTR over LPTSTR, L"" over TEXT("").

## File Manager
- This is a modernized derivative of the classic Windows File Manager codebase.
- When creating new source files, OMIT the file-level comment header.
- Always run the build with `bash scripts/build-winfile.sh` after making changes.
