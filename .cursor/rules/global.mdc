# Heirloom apps
- This is two different apps: winfile and progman.
- C++ 20
- Vanilla Win32
- We only support Windows 10 and above. Don't support older systems.
- We only support Unicode. Don't support ANSI. Use WCHAR over TCHAR, LPWSTR over LPTSTR, L"" over TEXT("").
- Do not run the apps. I will run them myself in the debugger for testing.

## File Manager
- Directory: src/winfile/
- Always run the build with `bash src/build-winfile.sh` after making changes.
- This is the classic Windows File Manager codebase.
- When creating new source files, OMIT the file-level comment header.

## Program Manager 
- Directories: src/progman/, src/libprogman/, src/libprogman_tests
- Always run the build with `bash src/build-progman.sh` after making changes.
- Prefer the C++ Standard Library like std::wstring over old fashioned C like WCHAR* or LPWSTR.
- Use smart pointer classes. Avoid "new".
- Only use old fashioned C conventions when interfacing with Win32 API.
- Never use Hungarian notation.
- Member variable names have trailing underscores: fooBar_
- All functions use camelCase: fooBar()
