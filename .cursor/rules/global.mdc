# Heirloom File Manager
- This is a modernized derivative of the classic Windows File Manager codebase.
- This is C++20.
- When creating new source files, omit the file-level comment header.
- We only support Windows 10 and above. In new code, do not support older systems.
- We only support Unicode. Don't support ANSI. In new code, use WCHAR over TCHAR, LPWSTR over LPTSTR, L"" over TEXT(""), etc.
- Always run the build with ` bash scripts/build.sh` after making changes. Include the space at the start to work around a bug.
