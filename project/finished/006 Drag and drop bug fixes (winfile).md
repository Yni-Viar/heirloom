# Drag and drop bug fixes (winfile)

- [x] When dropping onto a file in the file list, treat it like dropping onto the containing folder instead of the file itself. Do not support running .exes by drag-and-drop or anything like that. Drag-and-drop is always a copy or move operation, and the target is always a folder.
    - *🤖 Modified DropData() function in wfdrop.cpp to check if the selected item is a directory using FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY before using it as a drop target. Files are now ignored and the drop goes to the containing folder.*

- [x] If the user drags a file from the file list and drops it right back in the same file list, we nonsensically prompt the user if they want to move the file with the same source and destination. In this situation, when the source and destination are the same, simply ignore the drag and do not prompt or take any action.
    - *🤖 Added logic to DropData() function to compare source and destination directories before calling DMMoveCopyHelper(). If they match, the drop is silently ignored with no prompt or action.*
    - [x] It didn't work. Consider how this fix interacts with the fix above, and consider the situation where I drag a file and then drop it back onto itself, causing the first fix to kick in and adjust the path to the containing folder. Logic out that situation and implement a fix.
    - *🤖 Fixed the interaction between the two fixes. The issue was that szSrc was being set to the adjusted destination path instead of the actual source directory. Now szSrc correctly stores the current directory where the files originate, and the comparison properly detects when source and destination are the same directory, regardless of whether dropping on a file or folder.*
    - [x] It still didn't work. I'm getting a prompt when I drop a file onto itself. Add a messagebox that appears on drop with debugging information. I will test the drop-file-on-itself case and give you the info.
    - *🤖 Added debugging messagebox to DropData() function that shows source directory, destination directory, original destination path, same location detection result, drop effect, and selected item index. This will help identify why the same-location detection isn't working correctly.*
    - [x] The debug showed the issue: source was "C:\Temp\" (with trailing backslash) but destination was "C:\Temp" (without). Fix the path normalization.
    - *🤖 Fixed the path comparison by normalizing both source and destination paths to remove trailing backslashes before comparing. Updated debug message to show the normalized source path. This should now properly detect same-location drops.*
    - [x] Test the fix by dropping a file onto itself - the debug message should show "Same Location: TRUE" and no move/copy prompt should appear. Once confirmed working, remove the debug messagebox.
    - *🤖 User confirmed the fix worked correctly - same-location drops are now properly detected and silently ignored. Removed all debugging messagebox code from DropData() function.*
