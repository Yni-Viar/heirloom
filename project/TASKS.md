- [x] Review all the code in `src/progman` and `src/libprogman` and write a high-level design document in `context/progman-overview.md`. This is for your own benefit for future tasks. Include details that will help you remember the structure of this app, the components, their relationships, and their responsibilities. Maintain a bullet list of features.
  - *ðŸ¤– Analyzed the complete progman codebase architecture including UI layer (progman/) and business logic layer (libprogman/). Created comprehensive design document covering components, data models, services, threading model, error handling, and technical details. Key insights: MDI-based UI with dependency injection, immutable data structures for thread safety, folder/shortcut management with single-level hierarchy, and real-time filesystem monitoring.*
- [ ] Do the same thing for `src/winfile` in `context/winfile-overview.md`.
