# Improve interactions with minimized folder icons (progman)
- [ ] When the bar is focused, F2 should start editing the name of the selected minimized folder.
- [ ] When the bar is focused, Ctrl+D (existing delete hotkey) should delete the selected minimized folder instead of the selected shortcut in the most recently focused (but not currently focused) shown folder window.
- [ ] When right-clicking on a minimized folder, a context menu should appear:
    - [ ] "Open" - Same as double-clicking the icon
    - [ ] Separator
    - [ ] "Rename" - Same as pressing F2 to edit the name
    - [ ] "Delete" - Same as pressing Ctrl+D to delete the folder

# Add drag and drop support (progman)
- [ ] Accept drags of arbitrary files and folders to shortcut folder windows. If a .lnk shortcut is dragged in, then simply copy that shortcut into the shortcut folder. If anything else is dragged in, then create a new shortcut to that target file or folder.
