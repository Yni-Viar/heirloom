# Bug fixes
- [x] Bug fix: After renaming a minimized folder, a second copy of the folder icon appears. This is likely because we have a filesystem watcher that detects the rename as a new folder, meanwhile the rename operation itself is probably trying to update the existing icon. We want the filesystem watcher to take care of it; the rename operation should rename the folder but do nothing else, allowing the filesystem rename to automatically become reflected in the UI via the filesystem watcher.
    - *ðŸ¤– Fixed the duplicate folder bug by modifying the LVN_ENDLABELEDIT handler in MinimizedFolderListControl.cpp to return FALSE instead of TRUE after calling the rename callback. This prevents the ListView from immediately updating its display and lets only the filesystem watcher handle UI updates when it detects the folder rename. The race condition between immediate ListView update and filesystem watcher update has been eliminated.*

- [x] Bug fix: If the filesystem watcher detects that a folder was deleted, but that folder is currently minimized, then it is not removed from the minimized bar. This is because the window itself gets hidden in actuality when the user requests minimization. To fix this, make filesystem change detections cause the minimized bar to update as well, removing icons whose associated windows no longer exist.
    - *ðŸ¤– Fixed the minimized folder cleanup bug by adding a `removeMinimizedFolder` method to MinimizedFolderListControl and updating the `syncFolderWindows` method in ProgramManagerWindow to call it when removing deleted folders. Now when the filesystem watcher detects a folder deletion, both the folder window and any corresponding minimized folder icon are properly removed, eliminating orphaned icons in the minimized bar.*
