# [NAME](#NAME)

`zip_name_locate` â€” get index of file by name

# [LIBRARY](#LIBRARY)

libzip (-lzip)

# [SYNOPSIS](#SYNOPSIS)

`#include <``zip.h``>`

`zip_int64_t`  
`zip_name_locate`(`zip_t *archive`, `const char *fname`,
`zip_flags_t flags`);

# [DESCRIPTION](#DESCRIPTION)

The [`zip_name_locate`](#zip_name_locate)() function returns the index
of the file named `fname` in `archive`. If `archive` does not contain a
file with that name, -1 is returned.

If neither `ZIP_FL_ENC_RAW` nor `ZIP_FL_ENC_STRICT` are specified, guess
the encoding of the name in the ZIP archive and convert it to UTF-8, if
necessary, before comparing.

If neither `ZIP_FL_ENC_CP437` nor `ZIP_FL_ENC_UTF_8` are specified,
guess the encoding of `fname`.

Only CP-437 and UTF-8 are recognized.

The `flags` are specified by [*or*](#or)'ing the following values, or 0
for none of them.

[`ZIP_FL_NOCASE`](#ZIP_FL_NOCASE)  
Ignore case distinctions. (Will only work well if the file names are
ASCII.) With this flag, [`zip_name_locate`](#zip_name_locate~2)() will
be slow for archives with many files.

[`ZIP_FL_NODIR`](#ZIP_FL_NODIR)  
Ignore directory part of file name in archive. With this flag,
`zip_name_locate`() will be slow for archives with many files.

[`ZIP_FL_ENC_GUESS`](#ZIP_FL_ENC_GUESS)  
This flag has no effect (its value is 0); it can be used to explicitly
denote the absence of encoding flags.

[`ZIP_FL_ENC_RAW`](#ZIP_FL_ENC_RAW)  
Compare `fname` against the unmodified names as they are in the ZIP
archive, without converting them to UTF-8.

[`ZIP_FL_ENC_STRICT`](#ZIP_FL_ENC_STRICT)  
Follow the ZIP specification and expect CP-437 encoded names in the ZIP
archive (except if they are explicitly marked as UTF-8). Convert them to
UTF-8 before comparing.

[`ZIP_FL_ENC_CP437`](#ZIP_FL_ENC_CP437)  
`fname` is encoded as CP-437.

[`ZIP_FL_ENC_UTF_8`](#ZIP_FL_ENC_UTF_8)  
`fname` is encoded as UTF-8.

[*Note*](#Note): ASCII is a subset of both CP-437 and UTF-8.

# [RETURN VALUES](#RETURN_VALUES)

`zip_name_locate`() returns the index of the file named `fname` or -1,
if `archive` does not contain an entry of that name.

# [ERRORS](#ERRORS)

`zip_name_locate`() fails if:

\[[`ZIP_ER_INVAL`](#ZIP_ER_INVAL)\]  
One of the arguments is invalid.

\[[`ZIP_ER_MEMORY`](#ZIP_ER_MEMORY)\]  
Required memory could not be allocated.

\[[`ZIP_ER_NOENT`](#ZIP_ER_NOENT)\]  
No entry of the name `fname` is found in the archive.

# [HISTORY](#HISTORY)

`zip_name_locate`() was added in libzip 0.6. In libzip 0.11 the return
type was changed from `int` to `zip_int64_t`. In libzip 0.11 the type of
`flags` was changed from `int` to `zip_flags_t`.
